    <p>I try to fill as much of my spare time as possible with activities and events. I am very extroverted, so a lot of my favorite things to do involve surrounding myself with other people. To teach you more about me, I'll tell you about a bunch of my
        interests.

    <h2>Soccer</h2>
    <img src="images/soccerpicture.JPG" alt="Goalie Logan" style="border-radius: 20px; width: 30%;">

    <p><span style="font-weight: bold;">THIS</span> is probably my favorite thing to do in the world. I have played soccer since I was five, and I started getting really competitive in 5th or 6th grade. Now, I play for my club's premier team as well as EPS,
        and I'm the main goalkeeper on both. I have been a goalie since the position was available, not because I naturally <span style="font-style: italic;">wanted</span> to, but because no one else on my team was willing. And despite the natural setbacks
        I face (such as being 5'3" and not being able to touch the crossbar), it stuck. This past season, the EPS varsity girl's soccer team won our conference for the second year in a row and made it into the playoffs. Soccer might be my favorite thing
        in the world, and I love it more than all of the other activities on this list.</p>

    <h2>Mixed Martial Arts</h2>
    <p>The dojo I train/work at teaches a combination of karate, kung fu, Brazilian jiu jitsu, and taekwondo. My introduction to martial arts was in preschool, and I really didn't care about it at the time, but I wanted to get back into it in 8th grade.
        I've been doing it since then and am now only a few ranks from my black belt. I also do weapons training, and I'm currently learning fan and dao sword.</p>

    <h2>Music</h2>
    <img src="images/btsconcert.jpg" alt="BTS Concert" style="border-radius: 20px; width: 30%;">
    <p>That's a picture of my cousin and me at a BTS concert in 2019. I listen to a wide variety of music thanks to my parents, but K-pop is my go-to. A lot of my friends flame me for listening to it, especially with the argument that it can't be that good
        if you don't understand the lyrics. But that is what Google Translate is for. And I think there is something to be said about music that can still evoke emotion without everyone being able to understand the words (ex: Despacito was <span style="font-style: italic;">how</span>        popular?).</p>

    <h2>Art</h2>
    <p>I think I have always enjoyed drawing, but only in around 7th grade did I actually start investing time into it. Until then, I thought I was just naturally not good at it, and practice would lead nowhere. I still don't go around showing off my art
        because I don't think I'm at a skill where bragging is deserved, but I doodle very often. I find drawing and painting very theraputic, as long as nobody is watching me do it.</p>
